# CustomAnnotations
  ## Use Case:
    Suppose that, you are a software developer working for Mars2020 Project and you are developing an API for Perseverance rovercraft 
    which hides various information of the rover from person who has different privileges in NASA and public.
    
    Privileges: Tech Lead, Chief Software Architect of NASA, Project Manager of Mars2020 and public.
    You are able to customize accessibility of different privileges. 
    
    Creating Custom Annotations:
      There are different privileges in NASA therefore you will be responsible of creating different hiding strategies.
  
    Implementing custom annotations:
      After you will create annotations, you will implement annotations into code.
    
    Testing application:
      Finally, you will write an unit test to cover all cases.
